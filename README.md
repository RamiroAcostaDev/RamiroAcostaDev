### About Me üë®‚Äçüíª :
I'm a developer passionate about continuous learning and creating innovative solutions through technology. Throughout my training, I have acquired knowledge and skills in JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, Next.js, MySQL, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI.
Although I do not yet have formal work experience, I have been dedicating my time to working on personal projects that allow me to apply all these technologies. Currently, I am developing an application for lawyers that facilitates the calculation of severance payments, a project that has allowed me to deepen my knowledge and skills.
I am enthusiastic about the possibility of collaborating in a team and contributing to real projects that challenge and enhance my abilities. My goal is to find a work environment where I can grow professionally and add value through my knowledge and experience.
